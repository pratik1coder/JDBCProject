As the name suggests,this is a project on JDBC(Java DataBase Connectivity).

This project consists of the following-
*Connecting a MySQL Database with Java.
*Submitting SQL queries to insert, update and delete data.
*Handling SQL parameters with the help of Prepared Statements.
*Calling stored procedures and handling various parameter types(IN,INOUT,OUT).
*Reading and writing BLOB(Binary Large OBject) and CLOB(Character Large OBject) data files.
*Configuring the database connection information with properties files.

Statement Interface, ResultSet Interface, PreparedStatement Interface etc. and a few of the classes of "java.io" package,some of which are-
FileInputStream class, FileOutputStream class, InputStream class, Reader class etc.###
